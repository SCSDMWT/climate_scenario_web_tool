## What can this tool tell you?

You can use this tool to:

  * Help you to understand how climate change may alter the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events in an area in Scotland.

This tool does NOT tell you about:

  * Climate hazards for a specific property. To check a planning proposal for flood risk you should follow the guidance on using the SEPA flood maps for land use planning.
  * All possible climate hazards.
 

## What data underpins this service?

 
  * UK Climate Projections (UKCP18)
  * UK observations (HadUK-Grid)
  * Global temperature anomalies (HadCRUT5)
  * Regional boundaries from [spatialdata.gov.scot](https://spatialdata.gov.scot).

This tool visualises projections of future climate hazards using UKCP18 data specific to Scotland at different global temperature anomalies, with a ‘bias correction’ based on observations of past weather in Scotland (HadUK-Grid). 
Full details of the methods are available on the ClimateXChange website.
