# Accessibility

We want ScotClimATE to be accessible and usable for as many people as possible.

We try to make our site more accessible by following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 (WCAG 2) international standard to level A where possible. 
This standard can be viewed at [https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

This includes:

 * Making ScotClimATE keyboard navigable. There are no key-board traps.
 * Providing clear text descriptions for visualised results, and all actions on the site.
 * The information and interface in ScotClimATE are ordered in a meaningful sequence.
 * The use of colour is informed by colorbrewer2 recommendations.
 * All user actions can be redone or reset.
 * User interface is predictable, there is no change of focus with user interaction, and users are informed what their actions will do.

# Compliance statement

Scottish Government commits to making its websites accessible in line with the accessibility regulations. This accessibility statement applies to the ScotClimATE tool

This statement was prepared on 19 February 2026 and last reviewed on 19 February 2026.

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) version 2.1 (WCAG) A and AA success criteria.

The website was reviewed by the development team and revised to reach WCAG 2 level-A. It has not undergone an external accessibility audit.

## Non-accessible content

## Not compliant with the accessibility regulations

Some information in ScotClimATE is displayed visually using a map interface without full text description.

It is currently possible to force repeated flashing of the data display if a user quickly moves the sliders to set visualisation parameters in certain configurations.

## Disproportionate burden

ScotClimATE is built for visualisation of geospatial information, this requires a map interface to visualise. The map cannot be communicated through text and fixed descriptions as this relies on a large amount of geospatial information.

ScotClimATE has been developed in a short window, it would require significantly more development time and expert audit to validate against the WCAG 2 level AA standard.

## Not within the scope of regulations
